## Summary

Client library for Google Hangouts in nodejs.

## Disclaimer

This library is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Google. Use
at your own risk.

## Origins

Port of https://github.com/tdryer/hangups to node js.

I take no credit for the excellent work of Tom Dryer putting together
the original python client library for Google Hangouts. This port is
simply taking his work and porting it to coffeescript step by step.

The library is rather new and needs more tests, error handling etc.

## Usage

```
$ npm install hangupsjs
```

The client is started with `connect()` passing callback function for a
promise for a login object containing the credentials.

```coffee
Client = require 'hangupsjs'
Q      = require 'q'

creds = -> Q
    email: 'login@gmail.com'
    pass:  'mysecret'

client = new Client()

# set more verbose logging
client.loglevel 'debug'

# receive chat message events
client.on 'chat_message', (ev) ->
    console.log ev

client.connect(creds).then ->
    client.sendchatmessage('UgzJilj2Tg_oqk5EhEp4AaABAQ', [
        [0, 'Hello World']
    ])
.done()
```

## API

### High Level

High level API calls that are not doing direct hangouts calls.



#### `Client(opts)` constructor

`opts.cookiepath` (optional) path to store cached login cookies.



#### `connect: (creds) ->`

Attempts to connect the client to hangouts. See
[`isInited`](#isinited) for the steps that connects the client.
Returns a promise for connection. The promise only resolves when init
is completed. On the [`connected`](#connected) event.



#### `disconnect: ->`

Disconnects the client.



#### `isInited`

For Client to be fully inited the following must happen on
[`connect`](#connect):

1. Get login cookies against https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin
   or reuse cached cookies.

2. Using the cookies, fetch a PVT token (whatever that is) against
   https://talkgadget.google.com/talkgadget/_/extension-start

3. Load the chat widget HTML + javascript using the PVT token from
   https://talkgadget.google.com/u/0/talkgadget/_/chat

4. From the returned javascript get an `apikey` and some other headers
   used in each api call later.

5. Fetch channel `sid`/`gsid` from
   https://0.client-channel.google.com/client-channel/channel-bind

6. Using the `sid`/`gsid` open a long poll request against the same
   URL as in 5. This is the push data channel.

7. From first data coming through the push data channel, extract a
   `clientid` which also is used in each api call later.

8. Post a subscribe request against same URL as in 5 to make push data
   channel receive chat events.

Only after all these steps are completed will `isInited` return true.



#### `loglevel: (level) ->`

Sets the log level one of `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`.

### Low Level

Each API call does a direct operation against hangouts. Each call
returns a promise for the result.
